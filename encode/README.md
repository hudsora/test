Ascii85 RFC 1924
================

Ascii85 provides an effecient packing of four bytes into five printable characters.
(More compact that uuencode or Base64)

The symbol set is '0–9', 'A–Z', 'a–z', and then the 23 characters <tt>!#$%&()*+-;<=>?@^_{|}~</tt>. 
This avoids certain problematic characters <tt>"',./:[]\\</tt> .
